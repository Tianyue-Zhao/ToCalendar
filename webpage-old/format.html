            <h2>First of all...</h2>
            <p>ToiCalendar scans through the document row by row, so each row of your homework document should contain an assignment, while the first row contains headers, like this:</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Date</h2>
            Each assignment should have a date, which can be written in two ways:
            <h3>Start of week and day of week</h3>
            The popular "start of week + day of week" representation works with ToiCalendar, as long as: <br>
            The "start of week" column is labeled "week" in the header
            And...
            The "day of week" column is labeled "day" in the header
            <h3>Month and day</h3>
            If you prefer using the month and day representation, that's find as well!
            Just label the column as "date" in the header:
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
